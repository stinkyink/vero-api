# User API

Vero maintains a representation of each user you track with our API or CapsuleCRM integration. If you want to change any of your user's details, you can make use of our new User API. 

## Tracking users

    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>auth_token</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>String</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

## Edit users

    <th>Required?</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>

    "email": "new_email@getvero.com",
    "age": 25
  }
}
```

#### Note: Changing Timezones

By default our Javascript library will detect a customer's timezone and track this as a user attribute. The timezone is stored as a numeric value relative to GMT. PST, for example, would be stored as -8. You can manually override a customers timezone by updating this attribute in the same way you would update any other.

**Example request:**

```
PUT https://api.getvero.com/api/v2/users/edit

{
  "id": "james@getvero.com",
  "auth_token": "exampleAuthToken",
  "changes": {
    "timezone": -8
  }
}
```

## Edit user tags

### PUT /api/v2/users/tags/edit

This endpoint will update the tags for an existing user. The following parameters are accepted:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Required?</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>the unique string identifying the user. This could be user's email address.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>auth_token</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>your API authorisation token. This can be found by logging into your Vero account and selecting "Account" (at the top of the page)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>add</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>JSON array</td>
    <td>the tags to add to the user.</td>
